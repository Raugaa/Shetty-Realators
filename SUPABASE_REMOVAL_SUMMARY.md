# Supabase Removal Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed Supabase database dependency from the Sudhir Realtors React project and migrated to CMS-only storage with **localStorage persistence**.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Dependencies
- `@supabase/supabase-js` package from package.json
- All Supabase-related packages from package-lock.json

### 2. Files & Directories
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - Supabase client configuration
- `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` - Database type definitions
- `src/utils/supabasePropertyStore.ts` - Supabase property store
- `supabase/config.toml` - Supabase configuration
- `supabase/` directory - Entire Supabase config folder
- `src/integrations/supabase/` directory - Supabase integration folder

### 3. Code References
- All imports of `supabasePropertyStore` replaced with `cmsPropertyStore`
- All Supabase client imports removed
- Database connection strings and API keys removed

## What Was Replaced

### 1. Property Store
- **Before**: `supabasePropertyStore` with real-time database subscriptions
- **After**: `cmsPropertyStore` with **localStorage persistence** and local state management

### 2. Image Storage
- **Before**: Supabase Storage for image uploads
- **After**: **Local blob URLs** with proper memory management and previews
- **Future**: Can be easily integrated with any CMS image service

### 3. Data Persistence
- **Before**: PostgreSQL database with real-time sync
- **After**: **localStorage-based persistence** that survives page refreshes
- **Future**: Can be easily connected to any CMS API

## Current Architecture

- ✅ **Image management** with multiple images per property
- ✅ **Feature-based filtering** and search
- ✅ **Real-time UI updates** via subscription system
- ✅ **Mock data initialization** for first-time users
- ✅ **Memory management** with proper blob URL cleanup

### Admin Functionality
- ✅ **Add new properties** with multiple image uploads
- ✅ **Edit existing properties** with image management
- ✅ **Delete properties** with cleanup
- ✅ **Image upload interface** with drag & drop and previews
